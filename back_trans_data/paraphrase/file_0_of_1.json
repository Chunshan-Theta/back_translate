Li Mengxuan, the forecast officer for the Meteorological Office, stated that today, at 11:59, Taipei had averaged 38.9 degrees, which represented its highest temperature at the Taipei laboratory in July.
The key reason is that few clouds, high pressure envelopes, and solar heating have been found. In the afternoon, you can keep noting it, and it can hit a new high.
